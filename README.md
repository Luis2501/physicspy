# PhysicsPy: Physics with Python

**PhysicsPy** is a package of scientific computing with Python. This package was created to solve problems in *[computational physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_physics)*. In particular, this package has modules that allow you to solve nonlinear equations, integrals and ordinary differential equations. There are also examples of physical mechanical systems in the form of classes that allow to simulate the motion of these systems.  

Currently there are packages that serve this purpose, for example, Numpy, Scipy, etc.  However, this package aims to present an alternative for solving numerical problems. Specifically this package has an educational focus, but it is not excluded that in the future it could be used for other purposes.

For now, this package is still under development.

## Installation

At this moment, this package is not found in any package manager (such as pip or conda), because it is not yet documented.

## Requeriments

You will need to have [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) installed. On a Unix/Linux/Mac system, you may be able to install these using your Package Manager.
