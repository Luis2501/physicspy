# PhysicsPy: Physics with Python

**PhysicsPy** is a package of scientific computing with Python. This package was created to solve problems in *Computational Physics*. Although there are currently packages that serve this purpose, for example, Numpy, Scipy, etc. 
This project aims to present an alternative to solve numerical problems.
